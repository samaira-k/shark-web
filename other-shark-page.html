            <em>Cookie cutter shark</em> <br><br><br>
            The cookiecutter shark is one of the most interesting sharks in the ocean, and it never grows bigger than 18-20 inches (~50 cm). 
            It gets its common name from its feeding strategy of biting off small chunks of much larger animals.

            <em>Saw shark</em> <br><br><br>
            Check this out: sawsharks have a special tool called the "ampullae of Lorenzini" on their saw. 
            It's like their electric field detector for spotting hidden prey. <br><br>
            These guys are the ninja hunters of the sea, sneaking around slowly near the bottom, blending in like pros to surprise their dinner!

            <em>Bigeye tresher shark</em> <br><br><br>
            Bigeyes are easily recognized by their huge, upward-rotating eyes—10cm long! These eyes give them awesome vision, even in low light. <br><br>
            Plus, they've got grooves on their head that make them look like they're wearing a helmet. Oh, and their tail fins can be as long as their bodies! These sharks are both stylish and functional in the ocean.
